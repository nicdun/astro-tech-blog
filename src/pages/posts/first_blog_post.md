Welcome to the era where truth and fiction dance on a razor-thin edge. With the rise of AI, new technologies, and social media, our perception of reality is constantly being challenged. From AI-generated deepfakes that can mimic anyone to the carefully curated and often exaggerated personas we present online, the concept of authenticity is evolving rapidly.

Social media is the amplified, best version of most people on there. It’s a thin line that people can look over and feel afraid of not being enough. Creating a polished version of oneself has never been easier with the newfound help of AI. But this comes with the normalization of narcissism and superficiality for some, while others crave to attain this unreal perfection. We also see an increase in hurtful, hateful, and inappropriate, if not illegal, content all mixed in together with this altered reality.

This phrase—"Social media seriously harms mental health"—sounds like a clichéd topic given in schools for an essay or speech. But it is also famously seen on phone covers of celebrities like Gigi Hadid and Madison Beer. Ironically, I came across this statement on social media itself. This phrase has been aimlessly thrown around for a while, but is it true?

From the start of MySpace to the upcoming Metaverse, social media has always been the next big thing. But does the glitter on the tip of our tongues really hold more worth over the poison slowly destroying us inside? I bear no ill will toward being on social media, but I consider it a clever personal game between every individual and their carefully constructed profiles. Here are a few things I’ve found common in our opponent whose aim, I consider right now, is to seriously harm our mental health.

### Addictive by Design

Firstly, it was made to be addictive. The intent was to help release dopamine, the same chemical released when one drinks, smokes, or gambles. It trains our mental state to receive instant gratification from likes, comments, and notifications. It’s the same cartoonish trope of hanging a carrot on a stick and attaching the stick to a horse to make it walk forward.

### Distorted Reality

Secondly, social media acts as a reality check—an often distorted one. It presents an amplified, best version of most people, leading others to feel like they are never enough. Creating a polished version of oneself has never been easier. This normalization of narcissism and superficiality has caused some to obsess over an unattainable perfection, while others suffer from the constant feeling of inadequacy.

### Modern Escapism

Thirdly, it acts as a modern form of escapism. The more we engage with it, the more bland our real lives seem in comparison. Ironically, in our pursuit of connection, we disconnect from real life, becoming more isolated and missing out on genuine experiences. It teaches our minds that the virtual world is more exciting when, in reality, it is just a distraction that consumes hours of our lives—time we can never get back.

While most of us think we are in control, we usually aren’t. That’s where things take a turn for the worse. What starts as small insecurities, mistakes, and awkward moments can spiral into anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, and a failing mental state. The problem isn’t the existence of social media—it’s the battle within our own minds.

### The Choice is Yours

So, the choice is yours. Do you leave or stay? Do you let social media control you, or do you take control of your experience? Knowing how to navigate the game is key. Instead of striving to be someone else, strive to be your best self. Embrace your uniqueness, and you’ll unlock the door to authenticity. While the faux changes over time, the truth will always remain. Be true to yourself and the world around you.

How do we change this? By being genuine, one can foster meaningful connections and contribute to a more honest and trustworthy online community. However, this seems to stand lost. There is hope, though. As realization sets in, we see a larger percentage of Gen Z fighting the fever by switching to minimal, if not lowkey, presences on their socials. We are unafraid to be realistic and even pessimistic. Yet, there is a boom in content promoting healthy living, productivity, and originality. But will this continue? And is this truly an influence? Only time will tell, but the decision ultimately lies in our hands. Social media can seriously harm mental health, but only if you let it.
